# CleanHostel AI

Build a fully functional mobile-first app called CleanHostel AI.

The app should solve the problem of poor cleanliness and waste management in college hostels using AI image analysis, student reporting, and real-time cleaning management.

1. LOGIN

Create a simple login screen with:

Student Login

Admin/Maintenance Login

Email and password fields

CleanHostel AI logo

Tagline: “Detect. Report. Clean. Smarter.”

2. STUDENT HOME

After student login, show:

Hostel cleanliness score

Number of active complaints

Number of resolved complaints

Recent reports

Large “Report Cleanliness Issue” button

3. REPORT ISSUE

Create a report page where students can:

Take/upload a photo

Select hostel block

Select location

Add description

Click “Analyze with AI”

The AI should analyze the image and detect:

Garbage/waste

Overflowing dustbin

Dirty floor

Plastic waste

Food waste

Pigeon/bird waste

Other cleanliness problems

After analysis, display:

Problem detected

Waste/problem type

Severity: Low / Medium / High

AI recommendation

Example:
“Pigeon waste detected near hostel window. Severity: High. Cleaning recommended immediately.”

Then provide a “Submit Report” button.

4. MY REPORTS

Students should be able to see all their complaints.

Each complaint should show:

Photo

Location

Problem detected

Date and time

Severity

Status

Status should be:
Reported → Assigned → Cleaning in Progress → Resolved

5. ADMIN DASHBOARD

Create a separate admin dashboard.

Show:

Total complaints

Pending complaints

High-priority complaints

Cleaning in progress

Resolved complaints

Overall hostel cleanliness score

Display all reported issues in cards with:

Image

Location

AI detection result

Severity

Student report

Date/time

Status

Admin should be able to:

Assign cleaning staff

Change complaint status

Mark issue as resolved

Upload after-cleaning image

6. AI DASHBOARD

Create an AI Cleanliness Analyzer page.

When an image is uploaded:

Analyze the image

Detect cleanliness problems

Classify the problem

Give severity

Suggest an action

Show the result in a visually attractive AI analysis card.

If a real computer-vision API is available, integrate it. Otherwise, create a realistic demo AI analysis system using sample image classifications.

7. ANALYTICS

Create an analytics page showing:

Most reported hostel locations

Most common waste types

Number of complaints per day

Resolved vs pending complaints

Average cleaning response time

Weekly cleanliness score

Use simple charts and graphs.

8. UI DESIGN

Make the app:

Modern

Professional

Mobile responsive

Easy for college students to use

Clean dashboard design

Rounded cards

Attractive icons

Smooth navigation

Green/blue technology-themed interface

9. DEMO DATA

Add realistic sample hostel data so the app looks fully functional during a college presentation.

Include sample issues such as:

Overflowing dustbin

Pigeon waste near window

Plastic waste

Dirty corridor

Food waste near canteen

10. IMPORTANT

The app must be functional, not just a UI mockup.

Implement:

Login

Navigation

Image upload

AI analysis flow

Complaint submission

Complaint tracking

Admin status updates

Analytics

Responsive mobile design

Make the final application look like a real AI product developed for a college Design Thinking project.
